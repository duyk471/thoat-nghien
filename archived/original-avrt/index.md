The Barest Essentials of AVRT

**What is addiction?**

Addiction is a voluntary behavior (such as drinking alcohol or using drugs) that persists against *your own* own better judgment. Thus, addiction cannot be "diagnosed" or attributed to you by others, including physicians. It is solely up to you to decide if your drinking threatens or harms others and yourself. You must decide now whether continuing your addictive pleasures is worth the destruction that will likely result. In other words, you are free to *choose* between drinking and not drinking --- between the high life and family life, between right and wrong.

If you believe there is nothing wrong with your own drinking/using, then you are free to continue, provided you are willing to accept the likely consequences. If you *suspect* you have a problem with alcohol and other drugs, however, you probably *do* have a problem, and you would be very wise to learn how to summarily quit your addiction altogether. The more seriously addicted you are, the more likely it is that you will recover in a very short time by learning Addictive Voice Recognition Technique® (AVRT®), right here.

**What is Addictive Voice Recognition Technique® (AVRT®)?**

AVRT® is a thinking skill based upon the successful experiences of people who have [***independently recovered***](https://web.archive.org/web/20191018055206/http://rational.org/index.php?id=97) from serious addictions to alcohol and other drugs. Independent recovery is commonplace, occurring in every community many times a day. You know independently recovered individuals yourself, possibly in your own family, certainly in your neighborhood.

You originally possessed a moral conscience with the ability to choose between right and wrong. Addiction washed all that away. AVRT® re-connects you with your original, growing self, as you were before you slid into the swamp of addiction.

Recovery is accomplished through a personal commitment to permanent abstinence called, *the Big Plan,* backed up by the learned ability to catch yourself in the process of changing your mind. The ability to recognize the AV must be *learned* because, while in addiction, the AV appears to be you. Only in the context of your Big Plan, may the AV stand out for recognition.

AVRT® is not a form of substance abuse counseling, addiction treatment, occultism, spirituality, or religion. It is not part of, nor is it based upon, any psychological theory, including cognitive-behavioral psychology. AVRT is a summary of your native beliefs and values acquired during childhood but under assault by your addiction, ideas of honesty, integrity, personal responsibility, industriousness, love, affection, loyalty, self-discipline, compassion, cheer, generosity, and mutual respect. In other words, you don't have to learn anything new here, but only abandon your addiction and default to your original family identity -- no treatment, no new religion, no surrogate family, no evening supervision, no steps, no bad company. It's just you, all on your own, returing by free will to your right mind and original identity as an abstinent human being.

**What is the Addictive Voice (AV)?**

We all have a noisemaker in our heads that can create imagined sounds, such as music, sound effects, and the spoken language. The AV is the voice in your head that tells you to "Do it!" (drink/use) in a thousand different ways. It is not a devil or other companion on your shoulder, although it may sometimes create that illusion. It is a comprehensive style of thinking that perpetuates your addiction and, worst of all, appears to you to *be you.*

**Definitions:**

*The Addictive Voice (**AV) **is any thinking that supports or suggests the possible future use of alcohol or other drugs.*

*The Beast is addictive desire; the desire to get high.*

AV ---> Beast = Bark ---> Dog

The AV is the voice of your desire for the effects of alcohol and other drugs, a voice you can actually hear with your "mind's ear." We call your desire for addictive pleasures "the Beast®," a word that has both physical and spiritual dimensions. The AV is the *sole cause* of your addiction. In other words, *you cannot take voluntary action such as drinking/using without first thinking about it.* Those thoughts are your Addictive Voice, the voice of the Beast. You are responsible to recognize your Addictive Voice as always wrong, *in the strong sense of wrong,* i.e., immoral. When you learn to recognize the AV, it is no longer *you,* but"it," something that is *separate from you,* something you can *hear.* After all, no thought called "it" can do anything. Only "I" can execute voluntary behavior with my hands, mouth, and feet.

**But I'm a Really Tough Case!**

So much the better. The best motivation for addiction recovery is raw fear, although persistent anxiety and depression are also fine motivators. When finally faced with intolerable losses, many addicted people finally take the action they have put off for too long, which is a final declaration, "I will never drink again." Following that vow, many discover the remarkable ability to catch themselves in the process of returning to alcohol and other drugs. AVRT® summarizes the common thread of success among seriously addicted people who finally get a grip and abandon their addictions. With AVRT®, addiction recovery is always powerfully simple, regardless of how seriously addicted you are.

Although you may not yet be in the grip of horror, you may be sanely alarmed at the extent drinking/using is ruling your life, and see clearly where your addiction is taking you. Regardless of how dire your straits may be, AVRT® will guide you over the threshold to life after recovery in as short a time as you choose. Even today!

**"All I need is to cut back, drink moderately."**

You have come to this website because you are a problem drinker, which means that small amounts of alcohol disable your judgment so that, after "just one," you make the serious error of *continuing* to drink, which leads to deep drunkenness and grievous, antisocial behavior. Although this has happened to you many times, against your better judgment, *you are still seeking a way to continue drinking without getting into trouble. *This exactly fits our definition of addiction, a condition for which the only sane and reasonable remedy is to immediately and permanently discontinue the use of alcohol and other illicit drugs. If drinking/using were only a small pleasure in the larger picture of things, it would be logical and easy for you to walk away from it as you would a tasty food that always gave you indigestion. Alas, you have become a pleasure addict, and through the eyes of your addiction, you cannot imagine a satisfactory life without the *option* to get high. Such a life would be unbearably boring, without cheer and comfort, hardly worth living. That is the nature of your Beast, an animal mentality that thinks pleasure is happiness and survival. Poor thing.

The desire to drink moderately is a bit like wanting to be taller. The only people who want to be taller are people who think they're too short. The only people who want to drink moderately have already demonstrated they don't even want to. After all, if you actually *wanted* to drink moderately after having one drink, would you be a problem drinker? *All* problem drinkers have the death-defying wish to enjoy addictive pleasures without getting in trouble. The desire to drink moderately is a red flag for anyone having troubles related to alcohol and other drugs.

There is absolutely no difference between an "alcoholic" and a problem drinker. An "alcoholic" is just a problem drinker with a doctor's excuse. Others would say an "alcoholic" is just a self-excusing ass, a problem drinker who attends AA. *Don't pretend to be an alcoholic, or you'll end up acting like one. *A good case in point is the tragic story of Audrey Kishline, the founder of Moderation Management, a club for problem drinkers who yearn to continue drinking without getting into trouble. Full of good intentions, and supported by many counseling professionals, she ended up in jail for vehicular manslaughter when, while driving the wrong way on a freeway, she crashed into a car, killing a man and his young daughter. During her well-publicized incarceration, Moderation Management continued to grow, just as recovery groups always thrive in the midst of their own mayhem.\
If you continue your death-defying attempts to drink moderately, we hope you get all the pleasure you hope for, because your pursuit of pleasure is exposing you and others to enormous risks.

***You are not your body.*** You are a conscious, self-identity --- *a human being* residing in the body of an animal, *homo sapiens.* "Human" means, "not animal." A party animal is an *animal* being. Addicted people are animal beings. Recite this to yourself: "I am me, a human being. My body is it, an animal being. It, not I, wants to drink/use. I will never drink/use again." Feel your body's alarm when you say this.

***As a conscious, human being, you cannot be an addict or alcoholic because you are not a physical entity.*** Addicts function as animals, party animals, but are no less *animal* than a dog.

**\
Your body lives by the law of the jungle.** It wants you to do many animal things you know are stupid, immoral, gross, self-destructive, and harmful to others, some of which are also criminal. In addiction, your body is running the show. Alas, you are responsible for *everything* your body does, however much your body may want to do its animal things.

***You run your body.*** Your body is powerless to do anything without your direction or consent. Your body wants to run your life, but it can't. It must talk to you in your head, in English, commanding and telling you in a thousand ways to do animal things related to survival, especially pleasurable activities such as eating, sex, and the ultimate pleasure -- your favorite fix. 

**Humans live by universal family values,** such as these:

Honesty, integrity, personal responsibility, industriousness, love, affection, loyalty, self-discipline, compassion, cheer, generosity, and mutual respect 

In addiction, these human traits are lost without being missed by the addict. Through human eyes, significant others see the addict's coarse, animal disposition and feel alienated from him/her.  

**Here are some key definitions:**

**Addiction:** The high life. Persistent use of alcohol and other drugs to obtain addictive pleasures, against your own better judgment. Addiction is the *pursuit of pleasure* that exceeds the pleasures associated with survival, e.g., food, sex, O2, safety, shelter, etc. The desire for addictive pleasure  is accordingly stronger. Therefore, the desire for pleasure, even addictive pleasure, is a sign of robust health, not of disease. Addiction is a natural function of a healthy body exposed to synthetic substances and experiences.

**Addictive Voice (AV):** Any thinking, in words and images, that directs, supports or suggests the possible future use of alcohol and other drugs.

**The Beast:** Addictive desire. The animal desire for addictive pleasures, to get high. Your Beast is a perverted survival drive that speaks with awesome, sometimes God-like, authority, but takes on charming and seductive tones as well.

**Bark ---> Dog = AV ---> Beast**

Your AV will give you a hard time as you attempt to make your Big Plan. That's what AVRT® is for: defeating the thoughts produced by your body which perpetuate habitual self-intoxication. Remember, AVRT-based recovery is effortless for you, but a frightening, painful experience for the Beast. Poor thing.

**The Big Plan:** A principled commitment to lifetime abstinence from alcohol and other pleasure producing drugs, with no allowance for relapses, i.e., "I will never drink/use again." 

**The Recoil and the Reply:** When you make your Big Plan, you'll feel an emotional recoil --- anxiety or a sinking feeling. You'll also hear your head voice saying "Yeah, right. You can't say never," or  "You're doomed to fail," or, "Life's no good without drinking/using." The emotional recoil is the Beast. The head noise is your AV, i.e., "It." Your Big Plan forces the Beast into consciousness, creating the "I/it split" of AVRT-based recovery.

**Abstinence Commitment Effect (ACE):** The immediate and sustained, uplifted feelings arising from your Big Plan. The return of your human spirit and family values.

**Recoveryism:** Addiction disguised as recovery. Life according to the rules of addiction, e.g., "Never say never," one-day-at-a-time sobriety, "Imanalcoholic," recovery group disorder, infinite tolerance of self-intoxication, disease concept of addiction. (Clue 4 U: Recovery groups and substance abuse counseling are based on doctrinal forms of the Addictive Voice. Check it out, using the definition of the AV, above.)

**The goal in AVRT-based recovery is to live comfortably with residual addictive desire,** and not to silence or stave off your Addictive Voice. You should welcome the AV as a sign of health, and not as a threat, because your Beast is utterly powerless to act independently of your will.

**Stay away from recovery groups of all kinds,** substance abuse counselors, and other bad company as well. Set your confidence for lifetime abstinence arbitrarily at 100%, recognize all self-doubt as your Addictive Voice, seek worthy relationships, and you'll do fine.
