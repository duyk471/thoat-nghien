# LAST CALL, Now and Forever, for Visitors Under the Influence

**If you are under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs, even slightly,** come back on a day you haven’t been drinking. Your recent use of alcohol or other synthetic drug will filter out the beneficial aspects of this website and magnify what may appear to you as loopholes in powerful Rational Recovery concepts. Come back alert, fresh, in your right mind, and ready to undertake a very short journey into life after addiction _and after recovery._

Start here for mercifully swift, total recovery at this site:

- If you fear for your safety during withdrawal, there are medical treatments to prevent danger, but there are none for addiction. Only you can defeat your addiction. 
- You absolutely must _stop_ drinking/using (get sober) in order to learn how to _quit_ drinking/using (big difference). 
- Stop _now,_ to lessen your troubles. Do not engage in last minute drinking/using. Quitting something you love invites urgent drinking/using for old time’s sake, which is a recipe for destructive behavior and devastating losses. Don’t do it. 
- Monitor your thoughts for ideas of hopelessness, or feelings that your addiction is too severe to defeat on your own. Those thoughts and feelings are your Addictive Voice (AV), the sole cause of your addiction. Just don’t drink/use until you return. 

Drunk as you may be, I am sending you away with some fragments of Addictive Voice Recognition Technique® (AVRT®), just enough to _set the hook_ of AVRT deeply into your conscience and get your wheels turning in the right direction. The hook hurts until you remove it properly, as AVRT® instructs. You’ll probably feel the hook when you awaken in the AM. If you’re up to it, get back here and get to work.

**The Hook: the Big Question**

AVRT has only a few moving parts. The first is the Big Question; read it carefully: “Will I ever drink/use again?”

Bingo! The Big Question is a _forced response trap — the hook itself._ The hook is now in your head, now and forever. You can’t get rid of it, or forget it, or unread it, or ignore it because every time you think of your favorite fix, it will pop into your head like a nasty malware ad, “Will I choose to use?” with emphasis on _will,_ as in _free will_. By forcing you to choose to use, the Big Question nullifies your passive, “addiction.” Suddenly, your powerlessness is an informed choice, and you become fully responsible for that voluntary act and all of the harm and misery that flows from your pursuit of the high life. That hope for _control_ feels good. The Big Question always boils down either to your default position, (1) “Yes, I will drink/use whenever I see fit,” or, (2) _“No, I will never drink/use again.”_

The second moving part is the starting gate of AVRT, a powerfully simple declaration we call the Big Plan, a personal commitment that becomes the living spine of your character and sets you free from the chains of addiction. When you think of the Big Question, you will hear a discouraging mental voice, like this.

**The following are examples of Answer (1), above:**  

- I won’t/can’t answer that. 
- Imanalcoholic. Just one-day-at-a-time. 
- Damn right I'm gonna do it. 
- Screw it; just do it. 
- I don’t know. 
- I don’t _want_ to drink/use again. 
- I _hope_ I don’t. 
- This is a lot of crap. 
- _We’ll_ see, and hope for the best. 
- I’ll do _the best I can_ to never drink/use again. 
- _I have no plan_ to ever drink/use again.


The third moving part is _passive recognition_ of the AV — all of the above are examples of the AV, _the sole cause of your addiction._ From now on, your phony “addiction” is only _recoveryism,_ our synonym for “the high life”, “in recovery,” “sober,” and “sobriety,” all fully furnished with moral absolution, a grateful, supportive family, and your sacred Option to have gratifying relapses.

The only correct answer to the Big Question is, (2) “I will never drink/ use again." The Big Plan is the only remedy for addiction. All else is the sobriety scam — one-day-at-a-time, chronic addiction. Of course, you can’t make a Big Plan now because you’re all Beast™ and not in your right mind. The hook is in your flesh, so I will reel you in tomorrow when you’re ready to get human once again, or perhaps for the first time, ever.
