# AVRT-Based Recovery in a Nutshell  
 
**Am I addicted, or just a problem drinker/user?** It makes no difference whether you’re truly addicted or a problem drinker/user, because those words have little to do with reality. If you have problems related to your use of alcohol and other drugs, you are a problem drinker/user, and if you continue to drink/use against your own better judgment, you’re addicted.  
 
**Why am I addicted?** There’s nothing wrong with you that causes you to intoxicate yourself. In fact, addiction is a natural function of a healthy, human body, not because of any disease, nor some inherited defect, nor emotional stress, nor childhood misery, nor nutritional deficit, nor the tricks of codepenents and enablers in your life. You fell in love with the effects of your favorite drug, and your desire for that pleasure has overtaken all other loves and interests – even your sex drive. We call your _desire for addictive pleasures_ the Beast because it is _ruthless_ in its intent that you will use, use, use, for the rest of your days.  
 
**But I don’t drink for pleasure, I drink to feel normal, to cope, deal, and escape from problems I can’t handle.** The Beast speaks in your head in a special language called the Addictive Voice (AV), which is the _sole cause_ of your addiction. The idea that you drink/use for reasons other than the sheer pleasure of it is a perfect example of your AV. As long as you believe you drink to cope or deal with issues, you’ll likely continue struggling against your desire, and you’ll very likely have “relapses.” Actually, you’ll have _yummy_ relapses, choosing the best quality booze or drug you can afford. Once you make the decision to use, you’ll feel _wonderful_ , knowing how _wonderful_ you’ll be feeling very soon. Cope? C’mon.  
 
**My problem is that I drink too much. I need to cut way back and drink moderately.** The desire to drink modertately is unknown among those who actually drink moderately. Either you do or you don’t. It’s not that you can’t drink moderately; the problem is you don’t _want_ to drink moderately. Under the influence of just one drink, you _change your mind_ and have “just one more.”  
 
**I don’t really need alcohol, but whenever I drink, I get stupid and regret it next day.** You don’t get drunk and get stupid; you first get stupid and _then_ you drink. Because you are addicted, your thinking is backwards, actually _inverted,_ and you don’t learn from your mistakes. The Grand Inversion is the idea that drinking/using is an innocent act, a symptom of some hidden condition. That is _original denial,_ which turns your mind upside down, and turns you into an animal.  
 
**I’ve been to rehabs and recovery groups, but still relapse.** Groups and rehabs are based on the beliefs and values of addicted people, not the wisdom of those who have defeated their own addictions. _Sober isn’t good enough._ Sober means _between_ drinking or using episodes. As long as there’s a drink, fix, or relapse out there with your name on it, you will almost certainly have it, and your days will seem darker until you do. Abstinence is forever, the _minimum_ your family deserves. My family is very supportive. Only because they are afraid of you. Their “support” is little different from not aggravating any other unpredictable animal. As a traitor to your family, you deserve no support, and would better earn their respect through unending abstinence. What is Addictive Voice Recognition Technique® (AVRT®) AVRT® is family-centered, based upon universal family values. That makes it very different from addict-centered approaches which expect the family to accommodate the uncertainty of one-day-at-a-time sobriety. AVRT® is based upon the successful experiences of addicted people like yourself who abruptly recovered from serious addiction through a personal commitment to lifetime abstinence.
 
**1.** I finally face _intolerable_ consequences if I continue to intoxicate myself. 
 
**2.** I know my drinking/using is voluntary and solely for the purpose of pleasure, and because of that, my desire for addictive pleasures is an immoral disposition. 
 
**3.** I will never use again, and I will never change my mind. 
 
**4.** I hear the voice of my addiction rage against my decision, and recognize that my AV is the voice of my healthy body demanding unspeakable, destructive, addictive pleasures. 
 
**5.** I know that God, Mother Nature, or the “Committee of Two” gave me _free will,_ the ability to choose between good and evil. 
 
**6.** Endowed with free will, I am willing to endure any emotional distress which abstinence may bring. 
 
**7.** I realize that _all_ of my problems are caused by my self- intoxication and with abstinence they will fade and disappear. This brings me certainty of success and great emotional relief. 
 
**8.** Because my addiction blinded me to the feelings of others, I will ask my family and others I care about how, and how deeply, I have harmed them. 
 
**9.** I abjectly _apologize_ to my family for my _incorrigible self- intoxication_ because I knew all along but did not care that my quest for addictive pleasures was placing them in danger and causing them to suffer. 
 
**10.** _I surrender ideas of justice_ as a condition of reconciliation. I will continue to assess harm, assuming responsibility for all of the family’s problems, and apologize when I can. 
 
**11.** I am not my body, but a _self-identity_ in my mind. I have firm and final control over my physical behavior, and I can guarantee everyone I’ll never commit certain immoral acts. 
 
**12.** I now see both the animal and conscious realms of human existence, and know that human civilization is a fragile vessel of human consciousness on a sea of animal desire. Your recovery from addiction will be as difficult as you believe it will be and take as long as you choose. Your Beast says independent recovery is impossible, and you’ll have to struggle one-day-at-a-time against addictive desire, forever. That’s depressing, but when you imagine how it would feel to know beyond any doubt that your addiction is ended, you can feel the return of hope, freedom and dignity.
